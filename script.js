            <p>Hey beautiful,</p>
            <p>I know you're working incredibly hard right now, and I want you to know how proud I am of you. You're putting in 45+ hours a week, and that takes so much dedication and strength.</p>
            <p>Take a deep breath. Remember that it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes. You're doing an amazing job, even when it doesn't feel like it.</p>
            <p>Here are some things I want you to remember:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You are capable of handling whatever comes your way</li>
                <li>It's okay to take breaks - you deserve rest</li>
                <li>This stressful moment will pass</li>
                <li>I'm always here for you, even from across the world</li>
                <li>You look cute in your glasses btw, hehe</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Why don't you take 5 minutes right now? Put on some relaxing music, close your eyes, and just breathe. You've got this, and I've got you.</p>
            <p>Love you so much,<br>Your biggest supporter and fan, Divij❤️</p>

            <p>My love,</p>
            <p>I miss you too. So much. The 12.5-hour time difference feels impossible sometimes, doesn't it?</p>
            <p>But here's what I want you to remember: every day we're apart is one day closer to being together again. Distance is just a test of how far love can travel, and ours is traveling halfway around the world.</p>
            <p>Think about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Our video calls where we smile at each other until our cheeks hurt</li>
                <li>The way I get all excited when i first see you on screen</li>
                <li>The way I wake you up in the morning just to hear your voice</li>
                <li>All our plans for when we're finally in the same place</li>
                <li>How much stronger this makes our relationship</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'm looking at the same moon/sun as you, just at different times. When you miss me, look up at the sky and know that I'm thinking of you under that same sky.</p>
            <p>Until we're together again,<br>Always yours ❤️</p>

            <p>Hi sleepyhead (who can't sleep),</p>
            <p>I wish I could be there to hold you until you fall asleep. Since I can't, let me try to help from here.</p>
            <p>First, put your phone away and dim the lights (Now that I think of it, seems a bit impractical considering the fact that this is a website). Get comfortable, and let's try something together:</p>
            <p><strong>Close your eyes and imagine:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>We're lying together under a blanket</li>
                <li>I'm playing with your hair the way you like</li>
                <li>Your head is resting on my chest</li>
                <li>I'm telling you how much I love you and how proud I am of you</li>
                <li>You can hear my heartbeat, steady and calm</li>
                <li>Everything else fades away - it's just us</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now breathe slowly: in for 4 counts, hold for 4, out for 4. Repeat.</p>
            <p>If your mind is racing with worries, remember: tomorrow's problems can wait until tomorrow. Right now, the only thing you need to do is rest. You deserve peaceful sleep.</p>
            <p>I'm sending you all my calm and peaceful energy across the miles. Sweet dreams, my love.</p>
            <p>Always watching over you,<br>Your love ❤️</p>
